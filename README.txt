Details about the project:

Switching between players does not change the card panel to show the selected players cards. However, the functionality to implement that is coded but there was issue with
getting the function to change the GUI, this is mainly implemented in CardPanel class's showSelectedCard() method and playerSelectionController which could not be solved in time.

The addition of GameEngineCallBacks can implemented in the GameEngineCallbackGUI.

Adding enough players will expand the summary panel to include a scroll bar.
